## Overview
Outliers is a 10-week, summer program to empower exceptional student builders in Crypto and Web3 led by Ann Miura-Ko. Through curriculum and technical projects, Outliers equips students from across the country with the resources, knowledge, and community necessary to build and scale a successful Web3 venture. Cohort members will learn and build alongside talented peers, be matched with expert mentors, and have the opportunity to interact with world-class guest speakers. The community is backed by Floodgate, a top-tier seed-stage venture capital firm located in Silicon Valley with a track record of early investments in companies such as Lyft, Twitch, and Twitter.

Outliers 2022 will be organized as a DAO, seeded with $50k-$100k. The multi-sig will be handed over to members of the selected cohort; but, once the program is underway, we will reveal a big, audacious goal for this DAO. If students succeed, the DAO will live on.
