# Generative NFT Art - Floodgate Outliers

## Introduction
Created through the tutorial by the [Scrappy Squirrels](https://www.scrappysquirrels.co/) project.

Objective: creating generative NFTs for the [Outliers](https://www.outliers.build/) cohorts. 

To create images for the NFTS, run `nft.py` based on the assets folder!

## Overview
Outliers is a 10-week, summer program to empower exceptional student builders in Crypto and Web3. Through curriculum and technical projects, Outliers equips students from across the country with the resources, knowledge, and community necessary to build and scale a successful Web3 venture. Cohort members will learn and build alongside talented peers, be matched with expert mentors, and have the opportunity to interact with world-class guest speakers.

Additionally, Outliers 2022 will be organized as a DAO, seeded with $50k-$100k. The multi-sig will be handed over to members of the selected cohort; but, once the program is underway, we will reveal a big, audacious goal for this DAO. If students succeed, the DAO will live on. If the cohort fails, we will burn all of the tokens!
